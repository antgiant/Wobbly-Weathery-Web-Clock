A web based clock that shows the current time and also visually changes based on time of day and weather 

With thanks to
[BÃ©zier Clock](http://jackf.net/bezier-clock/) in [VanillaJS](http://vanilla-js.com) with some [easing options](http://www.robertpenner.com/easing/)

- [ ] Add option to have correct looking direction
- [ ] Figure out sun position via [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc/) or NOAA's Calculator
- [ ] Add background [sky color](https://github.com/dnlzro/horizon/tree/main/src)
- [ ] Dynamic time colors to remain viewable at all times
- [ ] Add [stars](https://github.com/mpetroff/nightsky) at night
- [ ] Add sun
- [ ] Add light pollution?
- [ ] Add air particle count impact?
- [ ] Add a giant list of weather related visualizations
